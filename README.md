# PythonRSSReader
Python based RSS reader
To run this program via linux (possibly OSX), do the following in a terminal:

1) cd {replace brackets and sentence with path to folder where project is downloaded}
2) source ./run.sh
3) enjoy


Sometimes it errors out with 'no such file or directory: '/rssWebSites.txt' This is a relative pathing error. Let me know and i'll try fixing it.

IF you find more rss feeds you're intersted in, add them to the rssWebSites.txt file
